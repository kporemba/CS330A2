## GitHub
Attached is a zip file of the code so that it can be downloaded. In addition, my website is posted on GitHub so that it can be accessed on mobile. There is responsive web design involved with the site that requires a phone to view the changes. Responsive Web Design will be explained further later on but for now here is the link to access the site: https://kporemba.github.io/CS330A2/home.html. 
I decided to create a website again because I wanted to develop my skills with making interactive activities. This decision results in me creating a project that is more complex than a poster or video version of the information. The challenge with this assignment was to create a text field quiz where users input their answers and it is cross checked with the answer key. More detail will be explained in quiz portion of the write up. 

## Homepage
The home page is meant to introduce the user to the webpage and allow them to get general knowledge of the topic before diving directly into the different tables. This page focuses on the SQL language itself, how it works and the language commands. This page follows a very simple format. As there are lots of key words with definitions or explanations that follow, the design was kept simple so that users can understand the concept at a glance. All key words are written in all caps to assist with easy understanding. Blue headers that reach across the webpage assist in breaking up the text, allowing the user to not get lost within the page. The navigation bar allows users to easily switch between pages, especially because of the ‘sticky’ feature. When users scroll down the page the navigation bar follows them allowing for quick access to the next page when you’re at the end of another. 

## Individual Pages
All four tables have respective pages that focuses on teaching the user specific commands. The topics are broken into 4 separate pages to allow the user to not feel overwhelmed with content. Each page is broken down into a main table, and the main commands to be learned in relation to that table. The webpages begin with a ‘How it Works’ section explaining the table given, and the commands that will be learned on that page. The main tables follow the description. At the end of the page is the Learning Check pages on the content from that individual page. Users submit their answer to the question in the text field provided to see if it is correct. 

## Tables
Tables are an integral part of the website. Each page has 2-3 tables that reflect different topics which the users use to test their learning. The information within these tables come from the W3Schools SQL lesson. These tables were coded by me using <table> tag and styled in CSS. The tables display best on browsers but because of responsive design, they work on mobile too. 
	
## The Quiz - Learning Check
Knowing that a learning check was required, I wanted to take it a step further than having a separate quiz section to test learning. This time, I wanted to incorporate the learning directly within the content. This was achieved by having a Learning Check at the end of each Individual Page. Since each page details a different table, I was able to create a Learning Check based on that specific table. The learning check has two main areas: the new table that they are supposed to generate, and the text field where they write their answer. Above the text field, there is a paragraph explaining which commands the user should use when creating their answer. Once users have their answer, they submit it to either get a ‘Good Job’ or ‘Try Again’. Users are encouraged to try again, consult the first page, or see the answer page if they cannot figure out the answer.  This Learning Check is meant to be more challenging than a normal quiz, but this ensure the most comprehension is happening. The answers page allows the user to see the correct answer if they cannot figure it out themselves. The choice to have a separate page to hold all answers allows the user to keep trying and not see the answer before they are ready to get help. 

## Responsive Web Design
In addition to making this website for desktop use, I wanted to make it accessible on mobile in a legible manner. This involved the use of responsive web design. To achieve this, I created specific styling in my CSS to reflect changes when the browser width is less than 600px.  Key changes between desktop and mobile are: the nav bar becomes smaller, font size increases, and tables become smaller. Having the nav bar switch from one long line to having 3 options stacked on top of each other allows the user to access the pages better. The title tags (h1/h2/h3) become smaller so that they don’t take up a lot of the screen, and the p tags become slightly larger for easy reading. The tables also respond to the smaller screen, fitting the width of the smaller screen. Overall, the implementation of responsive web design is meant to improve user experience on the site and provide a new way of looking at the site. site.
